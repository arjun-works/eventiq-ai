EventIQ Development Team Collaboration Guide
==========================================

This guide explains how 10 team members can collaborate effectively on the EventIQ 
codebase using Git, with each member working on separate modules independently.

## ÔøΩ **10-Member Team Git Workflow Strategy**

### **Team Structure & Module Assignment**

Your EventIQ system is perfectly designed for team collaboration with **14 independent modules**. Here's the recommended team assignment:

| Team Member | Primary Module(s) | Git Branch Pattern | Responsibilities |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Member 1** | `dashboard.py` | `feature/dashboard-*` | Main dashboard & real-time metrics |
| **Member 2** | `event_setup.py` | `feature/event-setup-*` | Corporate IT event management |
| **Member 3** | `budget.py` | `feature/budget-*` | Financial management & analytics |
| **Member 4** | `participants.py` | `feature/participants-*` | Participant management & bulk import |
| **Member 5** | `media_gallery.py` | `feature/media-*` | File uploads & media processing |
| **Member 6** | `vendors.py` | `feature/vendors-*` | Vendor management & contracts |
| **Member 7** | `certificates.py` | `feature/certificates-*` | Certificate generation & downloads |
| **Member 8** | `analytics.py` | `feature/analytics-*` | Data visualization & reporting |
| **Member 9** | `settings.py` + `config.py` | `feature/config-*` | System configuration & security |
| **Member 10** | `workflows.py` + `feedback.py` | `feature/workflows-*` | Process automation & feedback |

### **Additional Modules for Cross-Team Support:**
- `volunteers.py`, `booths.py`, `constants.py`, `utils.py` - Shared responsibilities

## üåø **Git Branching Strategy**

### **Main Branch Structure:**
```
main (production-ready)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop (integration branch)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/dashboard-enhancements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/budget-analytics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/media-upload-improvements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/participant-bulk-import
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/urgent-bug-fixes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ release/v2.0.0
```

### **Branch Naming Convention:**
- **Feature branches:** `feature/module-name-description`
  - `feature/dashboard-realtime-metrics`
  - `feature/budget-expense-tracking` 
  - `feature/media-gallery-video-support`
- **Bug fixes:** `bugfix/module-name-issue`
- **Hotfixes:** `hotfix/critical-issue-description`
- **Releases:** `release/v1.2.0`

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Collaboration Workflow**

### **1. Initial Repository Setup (Team Lead)**

```bash
# Initialize Git repository (if not already done)
cd eventiq-ai
git init
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>

# Create initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial EventIQ modular architecture with 14 modules"
git push -u origin main

# Create develop branch
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop
```

### **2. Team Member Setup (Each Developer)**

Each team member should follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd eventiq-ai

# Set up local development
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create personal feature branch
git checkout -b feature/dashboard-enhancements  # Replace with your module
git push -u origin feature/dashboard-enhancements
```

### **3. Daily Development Workflow**

#### **A. Start Working on Your Module**
```bash
# Switch to your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-module-name

# Pull latest changes from develop
git pull origin develop

# Start working on your assigned module
# Edit: modules/dashboard.py (or your assigned module)
```

#### **B. Making Changes & Commits**
```bash
# Check what you've changed
git status
git diff

# Stage only your module files
git add modules/dashboard.py  # Your assigned module
git add modules/utils.py      # Only if you modified shared utilities

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Dashboard: Add real-time metrics for corporate IT events

- Added live participant count updates
- Implemented budget utilization charts  
- Added corporate IT event type filtering
- Fixed dashboard loading performance issue
- Updated dashboard for corporate meeting types"
```

#### **C. Regular Sync with Team (IMPORTANT)**
```bash
# Daily sync with develop branch (recommended: morning and evening)
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Switch back to your branch
git checkout feature/your-module-name

# Merge latest changes from develop
git merge develop

# If conflicts occur, resolve them in your IDE
# Then commit the merge
git commit -m "Merge latest develop changes"

# Push your updates
git push origin feature/your-module-name
```

---

## üî• **Conflict Resolution Strategy**

### **Common Conflict Scenarios & Solutions:**

#### **1. Multiple people editing the same module (AVOID THIS)**
```bash
# Prevention: Stick to your assigned module!
# If unavoidable conflict occurs:

git status  # Shows merge conflicts

# Open conflicted file in your IDE
# Look for conflict markers:
<<<<<<< HEAD
# Your changes
=======
# Other person's changes  
>>>>>>> feature/other-branch

# Resolve manually, communicate with team member, then:
git add modules/dashboard.py
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in dashboard module"
```

#### **2. Shared utility functions conflicts**
```bash
# When multiple people modify modules/utils.py
# BEST PRACTICE: Coordinate via team chat BEFORE modifying shared files

# If conflict occurs:
# 1. Communicate with the other developer immediately
# 2. Merge both changes if compatible
# 3. Test thoroughly after resolution
```

#### **3. Configuration file conflicts**
```bash
# For modules/config.py or modules/constants.py changes
# COORDINATION REQUIRED:
# 1. Post in team chat before modifying
# 2. Make changes in coordination with config team member
# 3. Test integration after merge
```
