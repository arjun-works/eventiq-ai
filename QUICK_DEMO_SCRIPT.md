## **Q&A PROMPTS**

**Anticipated Questions:**

**Q: "How does it handle large files?"**
A: "The system includes file size validation and can be configured with storage limits. For production, we'd use cloud storage like AWS S3 for scalability."

**Q: "What about security?"**
A: "Files are validated by type and size. For production, we'd add encryption, virus scanning, and secure authentication systems."

**Q: "Can it integrate with existing systems?"**
A: "Absolutely. The FastAPI backend is designed for integration. We can connect to existing databases, email systems, and third-party services."

**Q: "How many users can it handle?"**
A: "The architecture is built for scalability. With proper deployment (load balancers, database clustering), it can handle thousands of concurrent users."

**Q: "What about mobile access?"**
A: "The interface is responsive and works on mobile devices. We can also develop dedicated mobile apps using the same backend API."
